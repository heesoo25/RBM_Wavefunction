# RBM_Wavefunction

Goal: Use Restricted Boltzmann Machine to optimize the parameters of an Ansatz solution of a given quantum system to converge to a ground wavefunction.

Current status: Still working on putting together a working RBM for an Ising model

Next steps:
1. Create training data for the Ising model & test the model
2. Have this RBM be compatible with fermionic quantum systems
3. Make the code more versatile (compatible with various quantum systems without touching the main body of the code).
